User can perform queries and mutations when offline and these would be automatically synced to the server when they come online. It also enables working with locally cached GraphQL compliant data without access to server. It will leverage capabilities of Apollo GraphQL cache do deliver seamless experience for querying data even when server side data is not reachable.
